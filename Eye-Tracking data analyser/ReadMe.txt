The version of Python --> Python3.10

Operating System: Windows 10 & 11

We mostly work together simultaneously. For the most part,
while one team member was brainstorming and giving directions about the solutions, 
the other member was coding on a shared screen via Discord.
When we face issues in our implementations, 
we divide the task based on who is available for that moment and who has more knowledge on the topic.
Moreover, the cooperation between team members was efficient.
We also conducted our professor about our issues, 
and he helped us to look from different perspectives.
